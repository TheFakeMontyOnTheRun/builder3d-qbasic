Small '3D-game-engine' I wrote back in 1997, when I was 12-13 years old. This was my first atempt at a 3D game engine and the first time I realised VSD was a serious issue.

![Simple 3D game](/screenshot.jpg?raw=true "Walls and hallways. Everything done with tabulated screen positions")
![Lots of preset objects](/screenshot2.jpg?raw=true "There were some other object types as well. Even teleporters")

The screenshots (and the system itself) are all in Black-White since, back then, my 486 only had a BW screen.
